# Pose-Estimation
MediaPipe's Pose Estimation 
This project utilizes MediaPipe's Pose Estimation to analyze a dance video ('dancevideo.mp4'). It detects body poses, draws green neon dots on key landmarks, and outputs a resized video ('output_video.mp4') maintaining an aspect ratio of 1080p width. The result is a visually enhanced dance pose estimation video.You can use main.py code for any Pose video of your choice.
